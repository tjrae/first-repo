# Final-Project

I created a presentation on the history of computer programing. I am
choosing this topic because it was one of my favorite chapter we went through in class.
I chose to do this topic because I want to learn more about early programs in more
detail. And I am thinking about changing my major to CIS because I learned so much in
this class.

Objectives:
Talk about Programers
Talk about early programing
Include a example of coding 
Timeline of Programing
